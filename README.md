# Localization
POC code for localization on Jetson using Matlab and Lidar
Experiments for running localization using Gazebo, Matlab and the Jetson and Lidar hardware. 
The intent is to create a running example that can be ported over to the robot codebase once it is fully functional.

TODO:
1. Upload real map
2. Network table to ROS translation
3. Hook up real Lidar
4. Hook up to Rio and IMU
5. Productize init and shutdown
